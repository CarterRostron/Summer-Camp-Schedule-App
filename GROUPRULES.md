# Rules for Group Generation

## Activity Groups
The day is split into 4 blocks:
- am swim
- activity 1
- activity 2
- pm swim
When the "Assign Activity Groups" button is clicked, it will generate 4 randomly generated groups (that follow the rules described below) where each
person is present in each group.

Each activity has certain roles that must be assigned to staff. Anyone not assinged to a role should be given the role "Not Assigned"
- 1 trail sweeper
- 1 medical tent
- 6 running activity
- 5 free time

Each swim period also has roles that must be assigned to staff. Anyone not assigned to a role should be given the role "Not Assigned"
- 1 lifeguard
- 2 watchers
- 1 bongo
- 1 medical tent
- 1 trail sweeper
- 4 free time

Since no more than 1 group will ever be on break at a time, there should be enough spots to ensure that:
1) nobody gets a second free time assignment unless everyone else has already been assigned one. Also, try to avoid assigning someone to the same role in
both swim periods or in both activity periods.

## Chore Groups
The chore groups are the same the entire summer. They consist of 1 counselor from each day off group (so 6 chore groups total). 
main rules:
- can't have 2 people from the same unit
- can't have 2 peopel from the same day off group
- must have 1 senior counselor
